## 📖 The Analogy
> "Code that learns from its mistakes and passes that wisdom down to next versions."

Self-evolving repository implementing Lamarckian Self-Refining Library.

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept
**Evolutionary Theory** — Self-Correction

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does
Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current [[state.json]](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the laws of Evolutionary Theory to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or modifies files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally
```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
Code that learns from its mistakes and passes that wisdom down to next versions. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
A Evolutionary Theory-driven digital ecosystem where structure emerges from pure logic.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Self-Correction at scale. It shows how complex, beautiful systems can maintain themselves without human interference.

## 🔬 Technical Details
- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Self-Correction
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every 15 minutes)
