# 🧬 The Autonomous Zoo - Expansion Pack
### 15+ New Self-Evolving Mathematical Organisms

Welcome to the **Autonomous Zoo Expansion** — a new collection of unique GitHub organisms that evolve autonomously through mathematical principles. Each "organism" runs cycles without human intervention, exploring advanced mathematical concepts, physical dynamics, biological systems, and graph algorithms.

## 🌟 Philosophy
These repositories continue the legacy of autonomous code. They are digital life forms that:
- **Self-modify** their own structure based on mathematical rules
- **Commit changes automatically** via GitHub Actions
- **Explore** mathematical landscapes
- **Emerge** complex behavior from simple algorithms

Each project is a proof of concept that code can be beautiful, autonomous, and educational.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Explore a Project
Each project is self-contained in its own directory:
```bash
cd chaitins-oracle/
cat README.md      # Read the project documentation
python evolve.py   # Run one evolution step manually
```

### Watch Evolution Live
All projects have GitHub Actions configured to run every 15 minutes. Check the commit history to see autonomous evolution in action!
